##My Dotfiles
___
I have been using linux off and on for 10+ years, and I never actually set up my dotfiles. Well a few months ago I finally made the switch to linux fulltime, and it became obvious that I needed to customize everything I could. As a result I present to you my dotfiles*.


**coming soon**

*everything is heavly customized to me and my machine. It will probably break something. I am not responsible for anything that gets screwed up.
