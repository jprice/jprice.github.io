As [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) said [Dotfiles Are Meant to Be Forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/). So to be one of the "Cool Kids" I've decided to do the [same](https://github.com/jprice/dotfiles). I did a refresh of my dotfiles about 2 months ago, and I have currently based them off [Ben O'Hara's](https://github.com/benohara) [Dotphiles][1]. 

I've tried a ton of different [dotfile managers](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles), and finally decided to go with [Dotphiles][1]. I will eventually switch to using [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to manage them, as I have falled in love with it.


[Feel free to fork and contribute or use them.](https://github.com/jprice/dotfiles) I wouldn't reccomend using these without heavy customization, as they are set up for my work environment and may requre other files I have not included.

Below is the README.md from my dots



Installation
------------
Run dotsync `./.dotfiles/dotsync/bin/dotsync -L`

Configuration
-------------

See the documentation for [dotsync][3] for more information.

Backups
-------------
Any existing ~/.dotfiles will be backed up into `~/.backup/dotfiles/` if found


Oh-My-ZSH Theme Fix
-------------
This is only required if you use the trapd00r theme. Otherwise skip.

The them I use requires some extra steps in order to work. Just follow the following:


{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/bin # assume that your ~/bin exists and is in your $PATH
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trapd00r/utils/master/zsh_path
chmod +x zsh_path

cd /tmp
wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/W/WO/WOLDRICH/Term-ExtendedColor-0.224.tar.gz
tar xvzf Term-ExtendedColor*.tar.gz
cd Term-ExtendedColor*
perl Makefile.PL  # assuming you have perl-Makefile-Parser installed on your box
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}
