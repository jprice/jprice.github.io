<span class="fa fa-linux fa-5x"></span> A few weeks ago I decided to drop <span class="fa-windows"></span> [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com) for good. I've always been a fan of [Debian](http://www.debian.org) based distributions. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) is too "bloated" for my liking. So I decided to give [Crunchbang](http://www.crunchbang.com). Everything was smooth. I was in love. Then one day I made a boo boo. Some how I managed to delete the network manager app, and I had no internet access. Well shit... 

I could not find my [Crunchbang](http://www.crunchbang.com) USB drive I had made, but I had an [ArchLinux](http://www.archlinux.org) one laying close by, so I thought screw it. I had been playing with [Arch](http://www.archlinux.org) for a long time in a VM even when I was a regular span class="fa-windows"></span>[Windows](http://www.microsoft.com) user. I bit the bullet and plugged in the drive and away I went. 

The install process is very different than what I am use to, but it is not impossible. There are a [ton of great resources](http://www.google.com) out there.  It took just a few minutes and I was up and running. I couldn't be happier. I have a small problem with wifi, but I don't think it will be an issue to fix. I just haven't gotten around to it yet. I guess that's what I can do when I finish this post, huh?

Expect more [Arch](http://www.archlinux.org) posts in the future.
