##Getting things up and running
---
Well it's been a long time since I've done anything with my blog. I have lost the original blog from a few years ago, so I guess I have to start over. This time I am going a much simpler route. I am not using WordPress. It is just too "heavy" for what I need. Everything now is running via [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork) by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes).

I am still learning my way around [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so I may break things a lot here and there. The awesome thing is, if I do break something everything is hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com) pages so it is very easy to roll back. Again, I have not used Git much so there is another learning curve. I beleive I have the basics figured out. I have just never thought I needed to use any version controls. Turns out I was wrong.
