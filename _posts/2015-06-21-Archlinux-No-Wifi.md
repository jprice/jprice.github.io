<span class="fa fa-linux fa-5x"></span> So for a couple weeks I haven't been able to get Wifi to work. If you remember from a [previous 
post](http://jprice.io/archlinux/linux/2015/01/19/arch-linux.html) I was having problems when I first 
installed Arch. Well I got it fixed then, but now I have no idea what the problem is. Today is the day I'm gonna dig into it and finally fix it. I'll update this post with my findings.
